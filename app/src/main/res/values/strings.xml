\nAll throws are taken into account.\n
\nA pin is not considered fallen if it is leaning on another pin or on the Mölkky throwing
skittle. After a throw, fallen pins are put upright at the place where they fell.\n
\nIf one pin falls, the score is equal the number on the skittle. When more than one skittle
falls, the score is equal the number of fallen skittles.\n
\nIf a player (team) misses (has no scores) three times in a row, he/she (it) is out of
the game with 0 points. The game ends, when the first player (or team) reaches
exactly 50 points.\n
\nIf a player (or team) scores over 50, that player’s (team’s) score is lowered to 25 points
and continues playing.\n
\nSides of the Mölkky frame are set to 45 degree angle and thrower has to leave the frame,
to the rear, if the thrower goes forward and/or sideways, in other words over the Mölkky
frame, it is a foul and throw is (the) called as a miss (0 points).\n
\nWhen the team has 37 points or more, foul will be penalized by dropping the points to 25.
